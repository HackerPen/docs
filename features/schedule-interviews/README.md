## Basics

Scheduling interviews with others is one core feature that HackerPen has to offer. The goal is to make scheduling flexible for both interviewers, interviewees.

You can schedule a single interview playing a role of either interviewer or interviewee. Alternatively, we can schedule pair interviews with others, giving and receiving an interview at the same time.
