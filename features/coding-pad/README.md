# Coding pad

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** HackerPen uses many open-sourced tools to build the coding pad. We used a [React-based ACE editor](https://github.com/securingsincity/react-ace) for coding, and [a React-based markdown editor](https://github.com/uiwjs/react-md-editor) for displaying questions and solutions.
