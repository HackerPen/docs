# add your own question

HackerPen gives users the option to add a customized question. The question can be added with a markdown format, and any participant in the session can change the question.\


The custom question will only be saved for a specific session. If you want to add your question permanently to the HackerPen ecosystem, learn how to contribute to HackerPen's open-sourced question bank.

\
The custom question doesn't come with a suggested solution.
